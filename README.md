jurli, the Java URI Library
===========================

```
Note - work in progress: the library is very much work in progress, and it did not have it's first release yet. Check this website often for updates!
```

The library can be used to parse URIs, dynamically build URIs (without having to worry about forgetting to properly encode parts), and other functionalities related to URIs (canonicalization, relativization, etc.).


Features
--------
* permissive license (Apache 2.0)
* build according to the URI/URL (and related) specifications
* fully tested
* works correctly with internationalized URIs
