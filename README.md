jurli, the Java URI Library
===========================


Note - work in progress
-----------------------
**The library is very much work in progress, and it did not have it's first release yet. Check this website often for updates!**


The library can be used to parse URIs, dynamically build URIs (without having to worry about forgetting to properly encode parts), and other functionalities related to URIs (canonicalization, relativization, etc.).
